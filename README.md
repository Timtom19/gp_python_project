# gps_python_project

## Project description

Exactly what your project will do -- try to describe it from the user's perspective.

## Goals for Version 1

What is "in scope" for Version 1.0 -- what's the simplest possible version of your project?

To enable 

1
a) the creation of a token with a designated location (with the same properties as a physcial object RE: identity) AND b) which is either owned by someone or no-one and c) for which ownership can be transferred

Ownership means control over use or transfer

2
the ability to 'use' the token, as a basis for transfer of monetary value 

3
visualise the object associated with the token using phone

4
allow lockin for transfer based on gps and a required code

## Libraries / Other Technology Needed

Which Python libraries will you use? Do they have good documentation / tutorials?

other gps python projects utilising android developer tools

## Risks

What are the risks -- things that would stop your project from getting completed? For each risk, think about how you could mitigate it.

Not clear that there are adequate python tools to interact with android easily
